Perform ETL on several movie datasets to predict popular films for a streaming service

## ETL

### **Extract**
 The extract phase involved the data retrieval from sources like Wikipedia, Kaggle and IMDB.

 ### **Transform**
The transform phase involved pythonÂ´s labrary pandas, to merge data and transform it into dataframes so we can export it to SQL

### **Load**
The loading phase consisted in using psycopg to create the connection with pandas and our SQL database

## Results
After finishing our ETL process we have to tables in our database. One for movies and other one for ratings
